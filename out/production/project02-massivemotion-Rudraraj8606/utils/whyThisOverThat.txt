why "utils" name over any other name.
-> because arrayList and linkedList are in util package

ArrayList.java
    - why grow the arr geometrically and not by constant factor ?
      -> when I will use a factor of x1.5 or x2 to grow my old array length there will
         be fewer resizes which will give faster insertion, fewer memory allocations
         and overall better scalability for large data. Which I think here for comets and stars
         must be taken care.
    - why System.arraycopy and Arrays.copyOf ?
      -> more readability
    - line 65 to 66
      -> what if size is 5 and index 5
      -> that's why a check


List [interface]
    - not adding a method rangeCheck(index)
      -> to prevent wrong indexes as almost every List implementation uses index
      -> but as it will be public, but we want private.
